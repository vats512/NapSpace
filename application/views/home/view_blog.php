                                                    <p>I came to this city, fresh from college as thousand others, full of dreams and aspirations, aimed to achieve something big. Little did I knew, that I was entering a maze that would continue till eternity. The moment I stepped out of the train, I looked around. The place and especially people, all was new for me. But I knew I was about to enter my own world of independence. It was a bright morning and I was wandering on streets, in search of a nice place to live. After roaming for a couple of hours and talking to various sort of people, I found an affordable flat, owned by a decent couple. Three people were already living there, and I was the fourth to join the team. I had a couple of heavy bags (‘cause my mom was worried about what would I eat in a strange city).
As I entered the room, it was just the I always thought of ( how guys live in an apartment). Clothes on the couch, trash littered on the floor, pieces of cigarettes in the corner and bundle of notes on the board. I had handshakes, asked names and a short “Hi”, “What’s up dude?” session with my flatmates. They left for work, and I was there alone, a little nervous, and excited at the same time to live in this world I’ve always dreamt of.


Day 1 was tiring and mostly consumed in unpacking and cleaning around. Later that night, when everyone returned, we exchanged talks about friends, families, politics and had dinner together. Days started passing by, and I became good friends with everyone. We started going to pubs and bars on weekends together. Sometimes, we had one of those late-night, deep conversations, where everyone either discussed heavy-sentimental issues or showed concern about their future. But then, a couple of beers and we were back to “our fun”. 


Months passed and our bond grew stronger. Lately, I reached a stage in my life when you’ve lived your life in PG, made some “bros for life”, but you’ve to leave to another city for a new job. 


My journey has been beautiful, but moving out is bitter. I felt like a daughter, leaving her home after marriage. Though there were was no crying,  yet sadness filled my heart. We exchanged few hi5’s, good luck for future and “Damn, I’ll miss you a lot” faces. 


My cab arrived and I stepped out my PG, not knowing when will I these faces again. I turned around and looked at them for one last time. With a big smile and a heavy heart, I was about to enter a new life again, where I would have to go through this again. As I passed by, I wished I could rewind the clock and relive those moments. 


Sometimes, living in the past is better and peaceful than dreaming about the future….

                                                    Maggi. The tangled structured food serving people, especially students since always. :D It is a crucial component in student’s life. </p>

No matter how your mood is, mostly people end up eating it.
“Hungry? Chal maggi khate hai yar”
“Sad? Chal, teko maggi khilata hu”
“In hurry ? Let’s have maggi quickly”
Even outside a PG, whenever one goes to a thadi,
“Bhaiya kya milega?” 
“Sir chai… aur maggi” :)
</p>
<p>

The easy-to-prepare 2 min noodles have become an integral part of not only youth but folks of all age groups. The joy of eating it at 3 in the morning is totally priceless. 

</p>
<p>
The un-eatable food served at hostels and PG’s have inspired students to prepare different forms of maggi. Be it “veg maggi”, “butter maggi”, “egg maggi” ,“masala maggi” and the list goes on… But even today, the original, classic flavor is unbeatable! 
<p>
Few reasons that helped Maggi reached this level of popularity among the PG students are:
</p><p>
<strong>Cheap </strong>- Available in market at Rs. 10/20 etc.</p><p>
<strong>Healthy </strong>- Makes your stomach quite full.</p><p>
<strong>Easy to cook </strong>- Anybody can prepare it, just need to boil and add the spices given with the pack of maggi.</p><p>
<strong>Easy availability </strong>- Almost all the departmental store has it.</p><p>
A quick power meal at a busy 2 AM, although the ten minutes of watching the boiling maggi in the pan would be the longest ten minutes one would encounter. And, that too very satisfying. Morning, you can sit in a bus and can slurp it quickly while commuting. Breakfast is done even when you are short of time. It is one dish guys can try without any fear to impress their significant ones. So, it is pretty much a life support for students residing in PG.
To sum up, Importance of spinach in popeye's life = Importance of maggi in student's life. ☺


Leave alone the use of maggi to fill empty stomachs, it has been more or less successful in sharing moments with your friends or roommates. The late-night maggi with deep conversations have created endless, cherishable memories in our hearts.

                                                    <p>You’ve had your head in books for years,  got the grades, got into university - good luck! If you’re moving out, here are some tips to pack, so the new place will not let you miss your home. 


First things first: travel light. Generally speaking, PG rooms aren’t very big – especially if you’re going into halls. Several people are usually accumulated together, so it’s best to avoid over-packing and causing clutter.
Before you leave home, check what’s already in your accommodation – sometimes you’ll need things like bins and desk lamps, sometimes you won’t. Call up your landlord/lady, if you can’t find the information online.
Here a few things you’d like to carry with you:
 Essentials
Stuff your bed: A duvet, two or three sets of bed sheets, duvet covers, and pillow cases. It’s worth getting these in doubles, even if you’re in a single bed.Getting additional pillows and blankets can give your bedroom a ‘homely’ feel.
Basic cleaning products – Even if you have a cleaner, it’s unlikely he or she will clean your room. Some Febreeze, Flash, washing-up liquid, and sponges will go a long way.
Ear plugs – Believe it or not, there will be nights where you want to keep while those who live near you want to party, so ear plugs are a must.
First-aid kit
Medicines - At Least the general ones including fever, cough, cold, painkillers etc.
Everyday things – Whatever you usually use; shower gel, soap, shampoo, conditioner, moisture, and toothpastes. As well as hair products.
Bath towel and hand towels
Torch (in case of power cuts).
Umbrella - it might rain anytime. 
The Unexciting stuff
Stationery
Diary or files
Electronics – An extension lead, as you may not have many plugs in your room. Don’t forget any chargers for your phone, laptop, Kindle, or any other electrics you plan to bring. Take USB cable, WiFi box (if required) or a hard disk/pendrive with you.
Important documents – Passport, photos, National Insurance card, medical insurance, PAN card, Adhaar card or passport. Remember any confirmation letters of your scholarship or bursary, if appropriate, or acceptance letters from your university.
Credit/Debit cards.
The Cool Stuff
A small bag for going away on weekends.
Formal/informal clothes for various events.
Photos / Wall posters
Induction/Kettle (very important, usually at late nights)
Couple of glass/mugs/utensils to cook and eat! 
Digital camera, if you’re into photography. 
Finally, board games and a pack of cards – Armed with these, you’re sure to break-the-ice and pave the way to make some lifelong mates. 😊
